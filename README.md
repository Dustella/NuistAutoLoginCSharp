# NuistAutoLogin

This Project is a full remake of [NuistLoginCSharp](https://github.com/Dustella/nuist-login-Csharp), in memory of my very first programming project.

So, This is a project that automatically login to the NUIST network, store user config in a local file, and automatically login when the program starts.

Since it is a project to commemorative the old days, it is purposely written in a very old framworks that I used in those years, .NET Framework 4 and old fashioned WinForm.
